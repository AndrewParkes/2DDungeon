# 2DDungeon
Unity based 2D Sprite Dungeon Game

I am creating this game to learn and grow as a developer.
This is not necessarily everything done from a best practices point of view.

Goal:
2D Dungeon crawler with autogenerated Rooms
* Stationary camera on a room
* Autogenerated rooms with NSWE doors to other rooms
* Item room for different weapons and upgrades
* Final Boss room to move onto the lower levels

Multiple player types
* Knight - extra Armor/ takes less damage/ has a shield to defend
* Wizard - uses ranged spell attacks/ has a secondary spell attack
* Lizard - Move faster and jumps higher/ Causes extra poison damage

Multiple weapon types 
* Sword - standard weapon
* Dagger - Short range fast attack
* Wand - ranged spell attack
* Spear - quick ranged attack low damage
* Axe - Large attack area but slow attack

Multiple enemy types (Zombie, Skeletons, Bosses...)
* Zombies
* Skeletons
* Orcs
